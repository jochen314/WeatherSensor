# WeatherSensor
This is a service to drive a 433 MHz sender.

I cat replace the temperature sensor for an 'ALDI' weather station (SEMPRE Model 92596)

I revese engeneered the protocol of the temperature sensor.

This is the replacement, that now runs on my raspberry pi.

It has a MQTT interface. I drive the values using openhab.
